# Building a Common Guest Framework
https://git.target.com/data-engineering-gst-common

## Overview
The Guest Common Framework was an interesting challenge to create a unified "space" within Guest Data Engineering. The goal of this was to facilitate collaboration between two merging teams by establishing a shared repository, which would contain reusable code components, frameworks, and centralized assets. This centralized space would serve to enhance team collaboration and streamlined processes across the Guest Space

## Background
I initiated the project with a thorough assessment of shared components between the two teams, which involved in-depth analysis of both teams codebases. This was challenging, as it required a deep technical understanding of our space and also challenged me to find solutions for integration strategies. From this analysis, we began implementing our solution, which was to create a centralized repository with reusable code components, team assets, and the common CI/CD framework.

My next step was on developing the central code library, similar to Kelsa but customized for our specific needs. This involved significantly improving the existing code libraries with refined and new functioanlity and merging them together.

Additionally, I enabled our repository starter template to be a usable solutions for both teams while aligning it with standard coding patterns. 

This effort culminated in a unified repository that has been growing ever sense. This marked a key step in the integration of teams within Guest

## Results
- Streamlined future collaborative projects
- Implemented integrated CI/CD alerting for both teams
- Laid the foundation for team unification. This common space now has close to 15 active repos!
- Centralized team communication via Slack
- Reducing risk by standardized engineering practices
