## Overview
This challenging projects main objective was to adopt Talos, a common CI/CD framework, across the Guest space, aiming to enhance collaboration and operational efficiency between teams. My role was instrumental in driving this large-scale project, involving the integration of the majority of repositories which impacted numerous workflows

## Background
After comparing CI/CD frameworks of both teams, we chose the Engagement team's Talos framework for its superior functionality, requiring a major overhaul of repositories not aligned Talos. This was a challenge, as it involved restructuring a significant amount of repositories, which involved coordination of multiple processes

## Talos Migration
I began the Talos migration by starting restructuring one key repository. This task required a deep technical understanding of our CI/CD process and codebases to effectivly restrucutre the repository. This also involved identifying "gaps" during the restructure, and coming up with efficient solutions to these problems. The successful migration of the first repository was a milestone that set the benchmark for the remaining conversions.

Following this, I solely migrated the majority of the rest of the repositories, showcasing my capacity to manage large-scale projects effectively. Additionally, I mentored and guided other engineers for their migrations, and under my supervision ensured a smooth transition for all remaining repositories. My determination, along with strong project management skills and attention to detail, played a key role in the successful implementation of the Talos framework across teams

## Results
- Successfully completed the Talos conversion across Interactions, impacting over 15 repositories and enhancing both operational efficiency and technical capabilities
- Facilitated improved collaboration among teams
- Significantly reduced deployment times and increased release frequency, streamlining the product development cycle
- Improved system reliability and stability due to standardized processes
