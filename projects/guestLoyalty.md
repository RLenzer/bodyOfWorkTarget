# Guest Loyalty Refactor

https://confluence.target.com/display/~Z00B7TF/Loyalty+Refactor

## Overview
The Loyalty Codebase Refactoring project focused on restructuring and optimizing the existing codebase for our loyalty repo. The primary goal was to enhance maintainability, readability, efficiency of the code. 

By undertaking this project, I aimed to reduce technical debt, improve code quality, and ensure the codebase is adaptable to future requirements. 

## Background
The initiative to refactor the Loyalty Codebase came from previous experience working in that space, where I identified a need for refactoring based off several factors:

- Code Complexity: The existing codebase had grown complex and unwieldy, making it challenging to understand, maintain, and extend.

- Technical Debt: Accumulated technical debt was hindering our ability to quickly adapt to new requirements and efficiently address bugs or issues.

- Efficiency and Performance: Opportunities were identified to enhance the performance and efficiency of the code, which was crucial for scaling the loyalty program

## Approach:
- In-depth Analysis: Conducted a thorough examination of the existing codebase to identify areas requiring refactoring.

- Modular Design: Broke down complex methods into smaller, more manageable units with single, well-defined responsibilities.

- Code Duplication Reduction: Identified and eliminated duplicated code across multiple pipelines.

- Utilization of Utilities and Libraries: Leveraged and developed utility classes and common library methods for standardized functionalities.

- Incremental Testing: Adopted a cautious approach by testing new methods in a single pipeline before broader implementation


## Results
- Improved readability and maintainability of code
- Significantly reduced technical debt
- Enhanced code performance and reliability
- Laid foundation for scalable code in response to changing business needs
- Estblished a precedent for ongoing code quality improvement in the team
